This project is intended to demo a Hadoop MapReduce job.

For this demo the task of the MapReduce will be to determine the longest word
in each line of text of a given file, and then group the results by length.

To run, you must first install the latest version of Hadoop (or at least one
compatible with the 0.21 API).

The code should run on a stand alone installation and easily scale to a
cluster.
